<h1>About the Author</h1>

<img src="images/sado.jpg" alt="Sado Faraji" class="author-photo">

<p>
Sado Faraji is a writer whose work explores power, belief, obedience, and resistance — the forces that shape civilizations and the quiet rebellions that reshape them.
</p>

<p>
His writing moves between epic fiction, historical reflection, and political thought. Across genres, his work asks the same question: what happens when systems demand obedience but conscience demands resistance?
</p>

<p>
Through fantasy, history, and modern political reflection, he examines authority, memory, spiritual tension, and the human cost of power.
</p>

<p>
His books are written for readers who question structures, search for meaning, and understand that history is never silent — it waits for voices willing to remember.
